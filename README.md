# CIFAR10-image-classifier
Image Classification is a method to classify the images into their respective category of classes. The Machine Learning project includes libraries like Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, etc. 

This "CIFAR10" dataset used for training and testing consists 60000 images of 10 classes. which is of 50000 of training and 10000 of testing images.

It is recommended to have a decent GPU support or you may use Google Colab Notebook (remeber to change the runtime to GPU T4)
